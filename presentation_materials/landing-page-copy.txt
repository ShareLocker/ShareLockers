Buy and Sell Locally with Confidence.
[Get Started]


We all have unused stuff lying around that's still worth something.
But even with online auctions and classifieds readily available,
the hassles of shipping, scheduling, and safety keep the average
person out of the Sharing Economy.


ShareLockers enable peer-to-peer sales that are:

  Instant
    See something you want? Buy it in a few taps from your cell phone.
  Safe
    Sales are conducted in public places though our secure e-commerce platform.
  Local
    No shipping means you save money while staying green. Win win.
  Simple
    See it. Buy it. Take it home.
